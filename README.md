# DmDSE_cuda_acceleration

Accelerates a simplified version of application binding evaluation of the GenetIc Domain Exploration algorithm in doi:10.1109/TCAD.2020.2967046
The simplified version only estimates application latency on an allocated platform and does not consider communication, synchronization overhead, and power.
Speed up achieved is ~170x CPU time for 1046 applications on 5 different platforms.
